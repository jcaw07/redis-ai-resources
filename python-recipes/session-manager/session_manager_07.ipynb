Simply toast some bread, smash an avocado on top, and add a squeeze of lemon or lime juice and a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. You can also add additional toppings like sliced tomato, feta cheese, or a fried egg.\\n\\n- Yogurt parfait: Layer some Greek yogurt with fresh fruit (such as berries, chopped mango, or bananas), granola, and a drizzle of honey for a tasty and healthy breakfast.\\n\\n- Oatmeal: Oatmeal is a warm and filling option that can be customized in many ways. Try cooking oats with milk or water, and then topping with chopped nuts or nut butter, cinnamon, fruit, or a drizzle of maple syrup.\\n\\n- Breakfast sandwich: You can make a breakfast sandwich with eggs, cheese, and your choice of breakfast meat (such as bacon, sausage, or ham) on an English muffin, bagel, or toast.\\n\\n- Smoothies: Blend together your choice of fruit (fresh or frozen), yogurt, and a liquid base (such as juice, milk, or water) for a quick and portable breakfast. You can also add extras like spinach, chia seeds, or protein powder for an extra nutritional boost.\\n\\n- Pancakes or waffles: Treat yourself to a stack of pancakes or waffles! You can make them from scratch or use a mix, and top them with butter, syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.\\n\\n- Eggs: There are so many ways to enjoy eggs for breakfast! Try scrambled, fried, poached, or boiled eggs, or make an omelet or frittata with your choice of vegetables, cheese, and/or meat.\\n\\n- Breakfast burrito: Roll up eggs, cheese, salsa, and your choice of breakfast meat in a flour tortilla for a hearty and portable breakfast.\\n\\n- Fruit and nuts: Sometimes simple is best. Enjoy a piece of fruit (such as an apple, banana, or orange) with a handful of nuts or a nut-based energy bar for a quick and healthy breakfast on the go.\\n\\n- Leftovers: Don't forget that breakfast doesn't have to be traditional breakfast food!

      "- 2 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- 2 cups milk\n",
      "- 2 eggs\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for the pan\n",
